# JC--Console-Finances

## JC Console Finances

The motivation for this project was to create code in JavaScript to calculate the financial records of a company.

The code analyzes a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

JC Console-Finances produces a financial analysis of the following: 
- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
